    <p>Speaklink on Mobile does not support account registration or room/chat joining. This means, you cannot create a new Speaklink account using Speaklink Mobile, and you cannot join new rooms/chats on Speaklink Mobile. If you visit Speaklink Web on a mobile device, you will be redirected to Speaklink Mobile.</p>
    <p>To register a <strong>new</strong> Speaklink account, or to join a new room/chat, you need to do those on Speaklink on a desktop device (in your browser). Desktop examples include Windows Laptops/Desktops, Mac's, Linux Machines, and more.</p>
    <p>Esentially, you can only use Speaklink mobile to chat with/text existing contacts or to chat in existing rooms you created or joined. Anything else must be done on desktop.</p>
